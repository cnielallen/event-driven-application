# event-driven-application

This contains an example of an Event Driven Application which utilizes Solace Messaging Event. The application will receive an event message wherein it will store the messaged on the data and will publish a new message to the downstream after processing it. The application also has an endpoint to publish all of the data that are stored on its database.

Note: This is on draft. No test cases has been made yet. This is just used to illustrates how event driven application is.
